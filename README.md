## Introduction
This project involves creating a comprehensive sales performance dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides key insights into sales metrics, budget performance, customer and product analysis. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and consists of customer, product, sales, and budget data.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to analyze sales data to identify performance trends, compare sales to budget, and uncover insights by customer, product, and geography.

## Skills Demonstrated
SQL for data cleaning and transformation
Data modeling in Power BI
Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI
Data visualization and reporting


## Data Transformation
Data cleaning and transformation were performed using SQL, as demonstrated in the uploaded script. This includes extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) operations such as handling null values, creating new columns, and preparing the data for analysis.

## Modeling
The data model was created in Power BI with relationships established between various dimensions like customer, products, and time. A star schema was used with fact tables for sales and budget and dimension tables for products, customers, and calendar, as shown in the uploaded images.

## Analysis and Visualization
The dashboard in Power BI provides the following insights:
Sales vs budget comparison by month and year
Sales by product category and top-selling products
Customer segmentation and geographic sales distribution
Interactive filters to drill down on different metrics, including product type, category, and customer city

## Conclusion and Recommendation
The dashboard highlights key areas for improvement in sales and budgeting. Products such as "Mountain Bikes" are high-performers, but budget management can be optimized. It is recommended to focus on regional sales strategies to boost underperforming areas and allocate resources more effectively to product categories.
